# **Regression Modeling and Statistical Inference on Clock Auction Price Determinants** 
> - Conducted exploratory and correlation analysis to study how clock age and number of bidders affect auction prices, using visualizations and statistical summaries in R.
> - Built and validated multiple regression models, checking significance through F-tests, t-tests, and confidence intervals, and compared partial vs. marginal correlations to interpret predictor importance.
> - Performed residual diagnostics and assumption tests (normality, homoscedasticity, multicollinearity), refined the model with an interaction term, and derived prediction intervals for practical insights.
